# PosturinnScanner
An app which scans through every PÃ³sturinn tracking code and returns the time and first registered location

I made this after a friend from Akureyri sent me a birthday present as a gift in Summer 2022. He said he wouldn't give me the tracking code as I would be "hanging over it constantly", but I wasn't taking no for an answer. After running this for half an hour, I got the code, and was able to hang over it for the next two weeks!
